Introduction to Web Development


What have I learnt? We looked at Javascript and how to make different things return in the console

How did I use this in practice? We looked at a simple output to do with temperatures and whether or not you should wear a code

What did I find hard? Making sure the case matched as capitals/lowecase can mean different things in code.
