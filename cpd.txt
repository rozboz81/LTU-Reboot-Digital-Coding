CPD activity
Introduction to Web Development


What have I learnt? We looked at Javascript and how to use switches in the coding

How did I use this in practice? 
We made a simple calculator and also a script that said what drink/size we had ordered

What did I find hard? I really do not get what is happening in the code at the moment, so this is something I am going to have to look into on FreeCodeCamp in my own time. I have completed the html course on there so far, which helped cement my understanding.
